# time-series-forecasting
Forecast the temperature after 2 days by evaluating previous temperature data.

### Dataset and evaluation
1. Daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne from 1981 to 1990 
2. Training data is taken as temperatues from 1981 to 1988 and testing data from 1988 to 1990
3. SimpleRNN, LSTM and GRU methods are used and mean absolute error of each model is evaluated.
